Research Interests
======
I am primarily focused on Natural Language Processing, Data Mining, and Machine
Learning. I have an interest in addressing the challenges posed by information sparsity
in textual data. Specifically, my recent project centers around augmenting text data
by incorporating supplementary information to enrich its content. The objective is to
enhance its relevance and usefulness for downstream applications such as information
retrieval and text classification.

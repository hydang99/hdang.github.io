I have a passion for surrounding, especially involving exciting projects. Below activities are some projects and activities that I engaged in and (am proud of). Please feel free to contact me if you want to work or share with me interesting ideas to support the communities!

- **2016-2017** Volunteer Teacher for Street Children, Danang <br/>![](/images/volunteer.jpg)
  A project that I joined when I was in high school in Da Nang. We aimed to support children in need, especially street children. We targeted educational perspectives where we served as voluntary teachers to help them with coursework (and hang out with them). Besides, we try to build a warmful environment for these fantastic children, such as "gathering dinner" and "decorating their homes for the Tet holiday."
